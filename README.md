# Typing Speed Test

A project I did for learning Elm. You start typing and by the end of 60 seconds it will tell your WPM (words per minute) and CPM (characters per minute).

You can play it here [http://paulombcosta.github.io/typing-speed-test/](http://paulombcosta.github.io/typing-speed-test/)

Here's an image of it in action:
